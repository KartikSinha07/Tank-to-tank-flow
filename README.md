# Tank-to-Tank OpenFOAM Simulation

This repository contains a *CFD case in OpenFOAM* that simulates fluid transfer between two connected tanks through a short pipe using the interFoam solver (VOF multiphase model for waterâ€“air interaction).

---

## ðŸ”¹ Overview
- *Solver*: interFoam
- *Physics*: Two-phase incompressible flow (water + air), gravity-driven
- *Geometry*:
  - Left Tank â†’ initially filled with water
  - Right Tank â†’ initially filled with air
  - Pipe â†’ connects the two tanks
- *Dimensions*: 2D (extruded 0.01 m in z-direction)
- *Purpose*: Demonstrates free-surface flow, mixing, and turbulence between coupled tanks.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Case Setup
- *Mesh*: Generated with blockMesh (3 regions: left tank, pipe, right tank)
- *Initialization*: setFields used to fill left tank with water and right tank with air
- *Boundary Conditions*:
  - Tank walls & pipe â†’ wall
  - Open top â†’ patch (atmospheric pressure)
- *Turbulence*: Default laminar (can be switched to RANS like kOmegaSST)

## ðŸ”¹ Running the Case
```bash
# Clean old results
./Allclean

# Generate mesh, set fields, and run simulation
./Allrun

# Visualize in ParaView
